# Base64 Break Down & Decode

Often during our line of work, we see base64 encoded text that cannot be easily decoded. In most cases, this happens because multiple strings are joined together to form the complex block of code. This script can help ease decoding these kind of encoded texts by breaking it down and decoding it.

Save the base64 encoded text into a file called "encoder.txt" and run the script file using the command "./b64bdd.sh".
